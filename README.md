# Firefox-Cookies
Powershell script for retrieving cookies for Firefox on Windows specifically. Intent to grow to other browsers.

It's a fairly simple script, only like 16 lines. Not the most elegant, but it gets the job done. Meant to be run from a flash drive. Will locate the cookies since Windows stores the cookies in the same place all the time, the only variable really is the username, which is taken into account in the script.
